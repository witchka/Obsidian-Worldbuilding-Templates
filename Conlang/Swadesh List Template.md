The [Swadesh lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list) is a set of words common in most languages that is useful both to rosetta stone your way around an ancient language and also to help you begin to form your own. It’s a good set of words to start off a naming language, even if you have no intentions of it ever being spoken like Tolkien’s Sindarin or Quenya. 

Feel free to add words that you would want a translation for to the table, or subtract or simply ignore as needed. 

There are two additional columns, both optional. Inspiration word is for if you wish to take a word from a known language and change it to suit yourself, for example if you’re basing a language off of Latin or Greek or whatever. The second is a column to leave any notes that may be important to you about the word. 

If you are using this in Obsidian I **strongly** reccommend that you use the advanced tables plugin to help you keep things neat and tidy.
